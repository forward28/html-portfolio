<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have already taken one course of web page developer,
  but due to system limitations I was not able to put the front/back end and API online.
  I am able to make a small site for a simple user at the moment, but I would like more.

  I am 51. I am a yachtsman. I am very fond of sailing. I participate in regattas.
  My family also sails with me - 2 daughters and a wife.
  If they have the opportunity, they also participate in various regattas with me.

  I work in logistics, most of my life, but I would like to change something in this life.
  I speak Russian, Ukrainian, English. I can communicate in German.
  I am learning Danish. I like to study.
  I think that if I could find a job as a developer, my studies would go much faster.
  My eldest daughter is studying in Denmark as a Software Engineer.
  The youngest is still at school, in the 2nd grade.
